    "# ArpSpoof Man-in-the-Middle Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This demonstration illustrates a man-in-the-middle attack, whereby a malicious hacker on the same network as a client and server can intercept communication between the two. We will accomplish this by a technique known as ``ARP poisoning`` that modifies the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables on a different host. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before the Attack\n",
    "0. Find you erthernet interface of your server.\n",
    "1. What are the IP addresses of the ``victim`` and ``server``? *(hint: ifconfig)*\n",
    "2. What is the initial ARP table on the ``victim``? *(hint: arp, use the -n option to view IP addresses alone)*\n",
    "3. Can you test the network connectivity between the ``victim`` and ``server``? *(hint: ping)*\n",
    "4. How has the ARP table on the ``victim`` changed now?\n",
    "5. What is the route from the ``victim`` to the ``server``? *(hint: traceroute)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### During the Attack\n",
    "1. On the ``victim``, look at the results of ``ping <server IP>``, ``traceroute <server IP>`` and ``arp``. \n",
    "2. Start ARP poisoning by typing ``sudo arpspoof -t <victim IP> <server IP>``\n",
    "3. Now go back to the ``victim`` and look at the results of ``arp`` and ``traceroute <server IP>``. How does this compare to ``ping``?\n",
    "4. Try to visit the `server` from `victim`, you should not visit the `server` successfully."
